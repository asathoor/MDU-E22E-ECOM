## Stackoverflow

"Theme developers can alter how these images render.

To set them to different sizes yourself, there is this built-in way in the Customizer by going to **Appearance > Customize > WooCommerce > Product Images.**

Note that if you change your default values, your existing products' thumbnails, will need to be regenerated, so they exist with your new sizes. WooCommerce should take care of that automatically, but depending on the number of products and images on the site, it can take a while to process them all.

To adjust the image size in WooCommerce using CSS, you can target the specific classes or IDs associated with the product images. Here are some common CSS rules you can use to modify the image size:

1. **Adjusting Product Image Size on Shop Page:**
   If you want to change the size of product images displayed on the shop page, you can use the following CSS:

   ```css
   .woocommerce ul.products li.product a img {
       width: 100%; /* Adjust width as needed */
       height: auto; /* Maintain aspect ratio */
   }
   ```

2. **Adjusting Single Product Image Size:**
   To change the size of the main product image on the single product page, you can use:

   ```css
   .woocommerce div.product div.images img {
       width: 100%; /* Adjust width as needed */
       height: auto; /* Maintain aspect ratio */
   }
   ```

3. **Adjusting Thumbnail Image Size:**
   If you want to change the size of the thumbnail images, you can use:

   ```css
   .woocommerce div.product div.images .woocommerce-product-gallery__image img {
       width: 100%; /* Adjust width as needed */
       height: auto; /* Maintain aspect ratio */
   }
   ```

4. **Customizing Image Size in the Admin Panel:**
   You can also set the image sizes in the WooCommerce settings:
   - Go to **WooCommerce > Settings > Products > Display**.
   - Here, you can set the image sizes for the catalog, single product, and thumbnail images.

5. **Using Custom CSS:**
   If you want to add custom CSS, you can do this by going to **Appearance > Customize > Additional CSS** in your WordPress dashboard.

### Important Notes:
- Always check how the changes look on different devices (desktop, tablet, mobile) to ensure a responsive design.
- If you are using a caching plugin, make sure to clear the cache after making changes to see the updates.
- If you are not comfortable editing CSS, consider using a child theme or a custom CSS plugin to avoid losing changes when the theme is updated.

Feel free to adjust the width and height values according to your design needs!
